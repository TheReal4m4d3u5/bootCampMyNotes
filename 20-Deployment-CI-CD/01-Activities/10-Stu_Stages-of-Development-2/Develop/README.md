# Coverage Reporting

## Packages

* Explain the added packages to the root `package.json`.


1. test:component
Command: npx cypress run --component
Purpose: Runs Cypress tests specifically for component testing (e.g., testing individual React components). Cypress uses the --component flag to indicate it should run tests that are written for component-specific scenarios.

2. test:e2e
Command: npx cypress run
Purpose: Executes all end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress. These tests simulate user interactions with the application as a whole (e.g., navigating pages, form submissions).

3. test:gui
Command: npx cypress open --detached
Purpose: Opens the Cypress Test Runner in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) mode. The --detached flag allows the test runner to operate in the background, not blocking the terminal.

4. coverage
Command: npx nyc report
Purpose: Generates a code coverage report using nyc, a code coverage tool often used alongside test runners like Mocha or Jest. The coverage report indicates which parts of your code are tested and which are not.

5. test:coverage
Command: npm run test:component && npm run test:e2e && npm run coverage
Purpose: Combines component testing, E2E testing, and code coverage generation into a single command. This ensures that both types of tests are run, and a coverage report is generated afterward.

6. clean
Command: rm -rf .nyc_output && rm -rf coverage && rm -rf server/dist && rm -rf client/dist && rm -rf **/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo
Purpose: Deletes temporary or build-related files to ensure a clean state for development or production. Specifically:
.nyc_output: Removes temporary coverage data generated by nyc.
coverage: Deletes the generated code coverage report.
server/dist & client/dist: Clears build artifacts for the back-end (server) and front-end (client).
**/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo: Removes TypeScript incremental build info files.

7. prestart:dev
Command: npm run clean
Purpose: Ensures a clean development environment by running the clean script before starting the application in development mode.

8. postinstall
Command: npm run install:all
Purpose: Executes the install:all script after running npm install. This is often used to install additional dependencies or prepare the environment further after the main installation step.
These scripts are part of a robust development setup, combi


* Explain the updates to the npm scripts.


1. start
Command: npm run client:build && npm run server
Purpose: Builds the front-end application (client) and then starts the back-end server. This is likely used for production or a deployed environment where the client is served as static files.
2. start:dev
Command: concurrently "npm run server:dev" "wait-on tcp:3001 && npm run client:dev"
Purpose: Runs the development environment for both the server and client simultaneously using:
concurrently: Runs multiple commands in parallel.
wait-on tcp:3001: Ensures the server is available on port 3001 before starting the client.
server:dev: Starts the back-end server in development mode.
client:dev: Starts the front-end client in development mode.
3. server
Command: cd server && npm start
Purpose: Navigates to the server directory and runs the server's start script, typically used to start the server in production mode.
4. server:dev
Command: cd server && npm run dev
Purpose: Navigates to the server directory and starts the server in development mode. Likely uses tools like nodemon for hot reloading during development.
5. server:build
Command: cd server && npm run build
Purpose: Navigates to the server directory and runs the build script to prepare the server for production deployment.
6. install:all
Command: cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i
Purpose: Installs all dependencies for both the server and client by navigating into each directory and running npm install.
7. client:build
Command: cd client && npm run build
Purpose: Navigates to the client directory and runs the build script to prepare the front-end for production deployment (e.g., generating optimized static files).
8. client:dev
Command: cd client && npm run dev
Purpose: Navigates to the client directory and starts the front-end application in development mode, often with hot-reloading features.
9. seed
Command: cd server && npm run seed
Purpose: Navigates to the server directory and runs a seed script to populate the database with initial or test data.
10. cypress
Command: npx cypress open
Purpose: Opens the Cypress Test Runner GUI, allowing developers to manually run tests for the application.





* Explain the contents of the `.nycrc` file.



The .nycrc file is a configuration file for nyc, a code coverage tool often used in JavaScript and TypeScript projects to measure how much of your code is tested. Here's a breakdown of what each property does in this configuration:

Properties Explained
all: true

Purpose: Ensures that code coverage is measured for all files matching the include patterns, even if they are not explicitly touched or required during tests.
extends: "@istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript"

Purpose: Extends the default configuration provided by @istanbuljs/nyc-config-typescript. This simplifies the configuration by inheriting settings that are optimized for TypeScript projects.
check-coverage: true

Purpose: Ensures that coverage thresholds are checked. If the test coverage falls below the thresholds specified (typically in another section of the config or package.json), the test will fail.
include

Value:
json
Copy code
[
  "**/src/**/*.ts",
  "**/src/**/*.tsx"
]
Purpose: Specifies the files to include when calculating coverage. This configuration includes all .ts and .tsx files within the src directory.
exclude

Value:
json
Copy code
[
  "cypress/**/*.*",
  "**/*.d.ts",
  "**/*.cy.tsx",
  "**/*.cy.ts",
  "node_modules/**",
  "server"
]
Purpose: Specifies files or directories to exclude from coverage calculations:
cypress/**/*.*: Excludes all files in the Cypress directory (test files).
**/*.d.ts: Excludes TypeScript declaration files.
**/*.cy.tsx and **/*.cy.ts: Excludes Cypress-specific test files.
node_modules/**: Excludes all files in node_modules (dependencies).
server: Excludes the server directory (likely a separate back-end component).
reporter

Value:
json
Copy code
[
  "text",
  "html"
]
Purpose: Specifies the output format(s) for coverage reports:
text: Displays the coverage report in the terminal as plain text.
html: Generates an HTML report for viewing coverage results in a browser.
Overall Purpose of This Configuration
This .nycrc file is tailored for a TypeScript project and ensures comprehensive and accurate code coverage measurement while excluding test files, declaration files, and non-relevant directories. It outputs coverage results in both text and HTML formats for better accessibility and debugging.
