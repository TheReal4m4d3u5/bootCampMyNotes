Technical Design Document: Automating Testing in the Deployment Process
Project Title: Automating Testing in the Deployment Process
1. Problem Statement
The current deployment process does not include automated testing, resulting in code being pushed to production without verification. This leads to potential bugs and errors being introduced to the live environment, negatively affecting reliability and user experience.

2. Goals and Objectives
Goals: Integrate an automated testing process into the deployment workflow.
Objectives:
Automate testing to ensure code quality before deployment.
Ensure the solution is compatible with the existing tech stack.
Leverage free tools to minimize cost.
Integrate seamlessly with GitHub for CI/CD.
3. Requirements
Functional Requirements
Automatically run tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) on every pull request or push to main.
Fail the deployment if tests do not pass.
Provide detailed test reports for quick debugging.
Non-Functional Requirements
Compatible with:
MongoDB
Cypress
Vite
TypeScript
Express.js
Free to use or has a generous free tier.
Works with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
4. Proposed Solution
4.1. Overview
We propose integrating GitHub Actions with the deployment workflow. This solution will automate testing during the CI/CD process, running all tests before any deployment is approved.

4.2. Detailed Steps
Set Up Testing Frameworks

Unit Tests: Use a combination of Jest and supertest for API routes and logic testing.
Integration Tests: Use Jest to test service-layer logic with a test MongoDB database.
End-to-End Tests: Use Cypress to verify user flows in a simulated environment.
Integrate GitHub Actions

Use GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that:
Runs tests on every pull request and push to main.
Fails the pipeline if tests fail.
Testing in CI/CD

Add configuration files:
jest.config.js for Jest
cypress.config.js for Cypress
docker-compose.yml for a temporary MongoDB instance during tests.
GitHub Actions Workflow YAML Create a .github/workflows/test.yml file:

yaml
Copy code
name: Run Tests on Push

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      mongo:
        image: mongo:5.0
        ports:
          - 27017:27017
        options: --replSet rs0

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run Unit and Integration Tests
        run: npm run test

      - name: Set Up Cypress
        run: npx cypress install

      - name: Run End-to-End Tests
        run: npx cypress run
Deployment with Tests

Ensure that the deployment pipeline is blocked until all tests pass.
Use GitHub protected branches to require successful test completion before merging.
Monitoring and Notifications

Configure GitHub Actions to notify team members if tests fail via email or Slack integrations.
5. Cost Analysis
GitHub Actions: Free for public repositories and includes 2,000 CI/CD minutes per month for private repositories.
Testing Frameworks: Jest, Cypress, and MongoDB are all open-source and free to use.
6. Risks and Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Increased Build Time	Optimize test cases and only run relevant tests for changed modules.
Flaky Tests	Regularly review and maintain test cases.
Compatibility Issues	Ensure all tools are compatible with current tech stack before integration.
Misconfigured GitHub Actions Workflow	Test the workflow on a staging branch before applying to production.
7. Implementation Timeline
Phase	Task	Estimated Time
Phase 1	Research and setup testing frameworks	2 days
Phase 2	Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD	3 days
Phase 3	Write and optimize test cases	5 days
Phase 4	Test the workflow on a staging environment	2 days
Phase 5	Rollout to production	1 day
8. Expected Outcomes
Tests are automatically triggered and executed before deployments.
Bugs are caught during development, not in production.
Deployment process becomes more reliable, improving user experience.
9. Bonus: Common Problem-Solving Strategies
Besides the "Three Ws of Strategy," consider:

Divide and Conquer: Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
Root Cause Analysis: Use the "5 Whys" technique to find the problem's source.
Brainstorming: Collaborate with teammates to generate multiple solutions.
Prototyping: Test potential solutions in a sandbox environment.
This document provides a complete solution for automating testing in the deployment process, ensuring code reliability while integrating seamlessly with the existing stack.
